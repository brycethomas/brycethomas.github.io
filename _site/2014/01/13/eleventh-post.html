				<h2 class="content">A Successful PhD Workflow for Programmers</h2>
				<section>
					<p>I&#39;ve been working towards my PhD for almost three years now and have
tried a lot of different tools for improving my workflow during that
time.  For the sake of others about to start a PhD or currently
studying towards one, I&#39;ve decided to document what I&#39;ve found works.
I can summarise it in two words -- <em>plain text</em>.  You want all of the
artifacts you create throughout your PhD to be reproducible from plain
text.  The first thing you ought to do when you start your PhD is
this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">cd</span> ~
mkdir -p phd
<span class="nb">cd </span>phd
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;echo \&quot;TODO: complete PhD\&quot;&quot;</span> &gt; build_phd.sh
chmod a+x ./build_phd.sh
build_phd.sh
</code></pre></div>
<p>The holy grail now is to maintain the ability to compile the entirety
of your PhD artifacts with a single call to <code>~/phd/build_phd.sh</code>.<br>
Allow me to get you off to a good start on building out
<code>build_phd.sh</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/phd
mkdir -p thesis
<span class="nb">cd </span>thesis
touch main.tex
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then open <code>main.tex</code> and add the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
TODO: write my thesis.
\end{document}
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now open <code>~/phd/build_phd.sh</code> and edit it so it reads:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">echo -e &quot;compiling my PhD...&quot;
cd thesis
pdflatex main.tex
bibtex main
# Run twice to get references right.
for run in {1..2}; do pdflatex main.tex; done
cd ../
</code></pre></div>
<p>You&#39;ve now taken the first step towards automating the build of your
PhD.  At this point you might be wondering why you just went to all
that effort to write a script to compile a latex document, you
normally just do that by pressing the pretty play button in LyX,
right?  Wrong.  The perennial issue you&#39;re going to face if you rely
on GUIs to produce results is lack of automation and painstaking
repetition.  At the moment your thesis document is super simple -- it
doesn&#39;t include any figures or calculated results.  As you analyze
data and include results though, you&#39;re going to want an automated way
to build those results into a final deliverable product e.g. the
thesis or a paper.  To be fair, having to press the &quot;compile&quot; button
in a LaTeX document will be the least of your worries.  Where things
get really painful is when you rely on GUIs to <em>produce the results</em>
going into your LaTeX documents.  Here&#39;s the thing about using GUIs to
produce your results -- whether you think so or not, you <em>will</em> end up
needing to produce those results again and you <em>will</em> forget what
steps you took to produce them.  Also you <em>won&#39;t</em> make a written
record of those steps, as it too is incredibly painful.  The best way
around this is to write scripts that perform the <em>equivalent</em> (not
identical) GUI steps and then call those scripts from <code>build_phd.sh</code>.
The first paper I ever wrote I failed to heed this advice and paid for
it.  Even though I wrote code to describe the simulation itself, I never
recorded the correct order of steps to actually run it.  As it turns
out, academia is slow as hell at giving feedback.  You&#39;ll submit a
paper and be relatively care-free for 6 months.  Then, the review will
come back -- <em>this work is good rar rar rar but could be improved if
you instead did x</em>, where <em>x</em> is some small variant on your existing
work.  Cue inertia.  The good news is, you&#39;ll find in research there
are nearly always equivalent command line tools to GUIs.</p>

<p>To give a simple example, lets say you have some processing you need
to perform over some data that requires either 20 clicks between
various items in a GUI or can be automated in code.  Let&#39;s assume the
output is the figure <em>my_cool_result.pdf</em> and it needs to make its way
into your thesis.  Recall our directory structure already looks like
this:</p>

<p>TODO: show structure.</p>

<p>We can add a line to <code>build_phd.sh</code> like:</p>

<p><code>python my_cool_result_generator.py &gt; ./thesis/my_cool_result.pdf</code>.</p>

<p><code>my_cool_result_generator.py</code> is now your written record of the steps
required to produce that result.  In programming, people always tell
you to write clear enough code that you could come back to it in 6
months and know what you were doing.  Even bad code is a record.  If
you rely on GUIs you&#39;re coming back to your work in 6 months with no
record of anything.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Microsoft Word in Academia</h3>

<p>Let&#39;s get this cleared up.  LaTeX is the worst typesetting system
except for all the rest.  Which makes LaTeX better than Word.  Word is
a great tool for basic documents written by your Mom, but not for your
thesis.  The biggest reason not to use Word is it breaks the cardinal
rule: <em>everything in plain text</em>.  Try automating in Word the
insertion of figures derived from your calculated results and let me
know how you go.  The second reason not to use Word is that like most
GUI tools it makes for a lowsy text editor.  You&#39;ll write a lot
throughout a PhD so it&#39;s worth taking the time to learn a decent text
editor (e.g. Emacs, Vim, etc.).  One of your objectives, for both your
PhD and becoming a more efficient computer user in general should be
to move away from relying on the mouse.  The GUI itself was a great
idea for making apps easy to learn and discoverable.  The computer
mouse, though lauded as a great invention, is not a particularly
efficient way to navigate a computer.  It&#39;s not even a particularly
efficient way to navigate a GUI for that matter.  If you&#39;ve ever used
a tool like Vimium in Google Chrome you&#39;ll see what I mean.  With a
single key combination you can bring up these little label thingies
over all the clickable links that prompt you to enter another short
letter combination to follow that link, rather than futzing around
with the mouse.  GUI and keyboards don&#39;t need to be mutually
exclusive, but I digress.  There other reasons not to use Word as
well.  Firstly, as crap as PDF (the output of LaTeX) is as an editing
format, at least you reliably know other people will be able of
reading it.  There&#39;s nothing worse than getting an email <em>Oh hai I&#39;ve
attached my paper blurblurblur.doc pls read and give feedback tnx</em>.
And then you don&#39;t have Word, so you open it in a purportedly Word
compatible program and it&#39;s mangled, usually not quite enough for you
to actually know that it&#39;s mangled.  You usually just assume the
sender messed something up.  Seriously though, even relatively
unsophisticated computer users have multiple devices now running
different operating systems.  Expecting other people to have Word
installed, especially in a technical field, is an insult.  There&#39;s
other lesser problems with Word too, like the default font choices
among other things looking like crap.  LaTeX was built for producing
publication quality works, and for all its shortcomings, it at least
does that.  Also, because LaTeX is plain text, it plays nice with
version control, which I&#39;ll get to shortly.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">How Not to Lose All Your Shit and About Version Control</h3>

<p>It doesn&#39;t happen as much anymore, but every now and then I hear a
story about how so and so lost all their hard work when their hard
drive failed.  For Christ&#39;s sake, it&#39;s 2014, at least get a Dropbox
account.  There is a better option though and that&#39;s version control.
If you&#39;ve been following along so far you&#39;ve already made a concerted
effort to keep all your various PhD artifacts in plain text which just
so happens is version control&#39;s forte.  Being a student you can get a
free Micro account on GitHub, so go get one.  This will give you a way
to keep a versioned copy of all your work stored privately on the
cloud.  Dropbox kind of sort of has version control if you look hard
enough for it, but it&#39;s rudimentary.  Dropbox also doesn&#39;t have any
notion of branching, </p>

<h3 id="toc_2">Collaborating With Your Supervisor(s) on Papers</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve had a moan already about receiving Microsoft Word documents from
people who expect me to be able to do something with it.  Then I
praised LaTeX as a superior option because it produces PDF output.
What I conveniently failed to mention is that when it comes to editing
documents, there&#39;s even less chance the people you&#39;re sending stuff to
have LaTeX installed than even Word.  Plus, even if they do, chances
are you&#39;ll decide you want to use some obscure LaTeX package that your
supervisor doesn&#39;t have installed, and so the document fails to build
on their machine.</p>

<!--  Once you start writing your thesis (and papers) you're
going to f
ind they need figures.  Those figures are going to be output
as the result of processing data.  Chances are you're going to mess up
that processing (and in turn your figures) many times over before you
finally get it right.  Have you ever had to work on a document in
Microsoft Word that required you insert a figure you created using
another program?  And you found the figure didn't look quite right
about 10,000 times over causing you to constantly click back and forth
between programs, reproducing the figure and then reinserting the
latest version into the document?  That's what we're trying to avoid
here.  LaTeX at least has the notion of referencing figures as file
names, so you can at least just update the file, manually recompile
and get the result you were after.  At a minimum you ought to
