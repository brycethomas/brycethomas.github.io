				<section>
					<p>USB OTG is an intriguing feature of Android that perhaps hasn’t gotten as much
attention as it deserves.  I suspect this may be in part due to developers not
knowing where to start.  When I
<a href="https://github.com/brycethomas/liber80211">partially ported a USB Wi-Fi driver</a>
back in 2012, there wasn’t much in the way of guides online—I assembled
the puzzle one disparate piece of information at a time.  My hope is that this
guide will bring all the relevant information together and ignite some more
interest in the area.</p>

<p>First, some background.  Android 3.1 introduced support for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_On-The-Go">USB
On-The-Go</a> (OTG).  This allows an
Android device to act as the USB host (much like a desktop computer) rather than
as a USB peripheral (e.g. USB storage drive).  Essentially, this makes it
possible to plug <em>other</em> USB peripherals into an Android device.  This is
interesting, as it means all manner of existing USB peripherals can be made to
interface with Android devices.  Some peripherals work out of the box.  For
example, many USB mice can be connected directly to an Android device and a
cursor will appear on the screen.  A lot of other peripherals however do not
have native driver support built into the Android operating system.</p>

<p>The way to get peripherals to work with Android when there is no native driver
is to use Android’s <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/usb/host.html">USB
Host</a> API
to reimplement the peripheral’s driver in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_space">user
space</a>.  The USB host API lets
applications register to be notified when a specific peripheral is connected to
the Android device.  This essentially becomes the entry point into your custom
user space driver.  From here, you can perform arbitrary byte-level I/O with the
peripheral.  From the Android operating system’s point of view, it has no idea
what those bytes mean, but this obliviousness is what affords the freedom to
implement a user space driver.  Because the USB host API is an officially
supported application API, there’s no need to root the Android device in order
to interface with peripherals.  Moreover, it means user space drivers can be
released on the Google Play Store.</p>

<p>Before we get too far into things, a word of a warning—USB OTG is still a
bit flaky in the Android ecosystem.  Some devices (e.g. Galaxy Nexus) support
USB OTG beautifully.  Some other devices mostly support it, but will require an
external power source for power hungry peripherals.  And some other handsets
just don’t properly support it at all.  For handsets with no support, this is
sometimes a hardware issue and sometimes a software issue.  Some people have had
luck with rooting certain handsets and patching the operating system drivers to
add USB OTG support, but this isn’t ideal.  Other devices flat out won’t work at
the hardware level.  So, even though Android &gt;= 3.1 is the formal prerequisite,
it can still be a bit of a mine field.  Hopefully USB OTG matures on Android
over time and by increasing awareness of the issues, perhaps this will help
expedite that process.</p>

<p>One more thing—Linux drivers are typically written in C while the Android
USB Host API is written in Java.  You’ll need to be at least familiar with both
languages.</p>

<p>What follows in the rest of this article is my best recollection of the steps I
took when writing my own first user space driver.  If you find I’ve missed
anything or have gotten something incorrect, let me know and I’ll fix the
article.</p>

<h3 id="finding-a-peripherals-existing-driver-source-code">Finding a Peripheral’s Existing Driver Source Code</h3>

<p>So you have a USB peripheral that works on regular Linux and you’d like to port
the driver to Android.  To find the Linux source code that’s handling the
peripheral, you’ll first need to gather some of the peripheral’s metadata.  Per
the USB protocol, every USB peripheral reports a few key pieces of information
to the Linux host upon connection.  The host then uses this information to
delegate responsibility for the peripheral to a specific driver.  The first two
pieces of information you’ll need are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Vendor ID</strong>: a 16-bit string which uniquely identifies the
peripheral’s vendor.</li>
  <li><strong>Product ID</strong>: a 16-bit string which uniquely identifiers the
specific peripheral.</li>
</ol>

<p>On Linux, you can retrieve the Vendor ID and Product ID with the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">lsusb</code> command.  Here’s an example of the output on my machine:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">~$ </span>lsusb
Bus 002 Device 011: ID 0bda:8187 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL8187 Wireless Adapter
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:8008 Intel Corp. 
Bus 002 Device 002: ID 8087:8000 Intel Corp. 
Bus 002 Device 003: ID 174c:2074 ASMedia Technology Inc. 
Bus 002 Device 004: ID 0b05:17d0 ASUSTek Computer, Inc. 
Bus 002 Device 006: ID 046d:0826 Logitech, Inc. 
Bus 002 Device 007: ID 045e:071d Microsoft Corp. 
Bus 002 Device 008: ID 046d:c531 Logitech, Inc. 
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>In the output above, the Vendor ID and Product ID on each line are the
colon-separated hex string. For example, the USB wireless card I had connected
to my computer at the time has Vendor ID <code class="highlighter-rouge">0bda</code> and Product ID <code class="highlighter-rouge">8187</code>.  If you
can’t identify the specific peripheral you’re interested in porting, unplug it
and run <code class="highlighter-rouge">lsusb</code> again to see which item is now omitted in the output.  Keep a
note of the Vendor ID and Product ID.  For the time being they’ll help us to
find the peripheral’s Linux driver source code.  You’ll also need them later on
though as a way of registering your Android application to handle connected
peripherals with that Vendor ID and Product ID.</p>

<p>[WARNING: this paragraph is vague—if this is an area you have
expertise in, please email me a better description of this step so I can include
it].  With the Vendor ID and Product ID in hand, you can now establish which
C source file is the driver entry point for your peripheral on Linux.  To do
this, follow the steps outlined in
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/11662033/129475">this Stack Overflow answer</a>.  Note
my comment on this answer hasn’t received a response.  Again, if anyone would
like to provide clarification on this step, I’ll look to add it to this article.
The rest of the article assumes you’ve been able to identify the “main” source
file for your peripheral’s driver.</p>

<h3 id="navigating-the-peripherals-linux-driver-source-code">Navigating the Peripheral’s Linux Driver Source Code</h3>

<p>You’ve located your peripheral driver’s main source file—let’s call it
   <code class="highlighter-rouge">foo.c</code>.  When your peripheral is connected, Linux delegates responsibility
   for the peripheral to the code in this file. The obvious next question is,
   <em>where in this file does the driver begin executing?</em> What you should look
   for in <code class="highlighter-rouge">foo.c</code> is a call to
   <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/htmldocs/usb/API-module-usb-driver.html"><code class="highlighter-rouge">module_usb_driver()</code></a>.
   <code class="highlighter-rouge">module_usb_drver()</code> accepts a struct of type <code class="highlighter-rouge">usb_driver</code>, so you should see
   in the call that something is being passed in.  This struct has a number of
   fields, but the one of immediate interest is <code class="highlighter-rouge">.probe</code>.  <code class="highlighter-rouge">.probe</code> is a
   function pointer to the method that initially gets called.  In terms of
   controlling the peripheral, this is where things kick off.  To give an
   example, at time of writing, here is what can be found in
   <code class="highlighter-rouge">/drivers/net/wireless/rtl818x/rtl8187/dev.c</code>:</p>

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">static</span> <span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">usb_driver</span> <span class="n">rtl8187_driver</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="p">.</span><span class="n">name</span>		<span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">KBUILD_MODNAME</span><span class="p">,</span>
	<span class="p">.</span><span class="n">id_table</span>	<span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">rtl8187_table</span><span class="p">,</span>
	<span class="p">.</span><span class="n">probe</span>		<span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">rtl8187_probe</span><span class="p">,</span>
	<span class="p">.</span><span class="n">disconnect</span>	<span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">rtl8187_disconnect</span><span class="p">,</span>
	<span class="p">.</span><span class="n">disable_hub_initiated_lpm</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">};</span>

<span class="n">module_usb_driver</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">rtl8187_driver</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Take note of the line <code class="highlighter-rouge">.probe = rtl8187_probe,</code>.  Sure enough, there’s a
function named <code class="highlighter-rouge">rtl8187_probe</code> in the same file that defines the code to be
executed when this specific driver is invoked by the Linux operating system.
It’s at this point that the driver logic becomes specific to the attached
peripheral.  In other words, what you find in the probe function will be
determined by what work the driver needs to do when your specific peripheral is
first connected.  In the remainder of this section I simply identify methods I
found useful for navigating the driver source code.</p>

<p>A tool I found particularly useful for analysing the source code of my USB
wireless LAN adapter was <a href="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/">CTAGS</a>.  Not to drift
too far off topic, but for the uninitiated, CTAGS is a program that can accept a
source code directory as input and product an index of the source code as
output.  This index includes information such as the file and line number of
function calls.  The index itself is designed to be computer-readable, not human
readable.  Text editors like Emacs and vi use the index to allow navigating the
codebase through keyboard shortcuts.  For me, the indispensable feature of CTAGS
was being able to recursively jump into and out of function definitions.
Essentially I used CTAGS to generate an index over the entire Linux source code,
so I was then able to perform this navigation through Emacs and vi keyboard
shortcuts.  Setting up CTAGS and choice of text editor however are beyond the
scope of this article.</p>

<p>The reason I heavily advocate CTAGS (or similar) for reading USB driver code is
that there are often many function calls separating a top-level function in the
main driver source file from where the actual byte-level data is transmitted or
received.  When porting the driver to Android user space, it’s ultimately this
byte-level communication you’ll need to emulate, so being able to quickly
navigate in and out of function calls is very useful.  A final word of warning
on CTAGS: it’s not always 100% reliable.  I once spent a whole day trying to
establish why a line of source code seemed to indicate a <code class="highlighter-rouge">0x0060</code> should be sent
over the wire while the corresponding USB packet dump indicated it was actually
a <code class="highlighter-rouge">0x0040</code>.  It came down to two different drivers with the same function
name—CTAGs happened to have taken me to the wrong file—I was reading
the code for a very similar but different driver.</p>

<p>One thing in particular to look out for in the source code is the term <code class="highlighter-rouge">urb</code>.
The Linux kernel has a USB subsystem which handles low level I/O between the
host and peripheral.  This subsystem speaks in terms of URBs (USB Request
Blocks).  For example, you might see calls to <code class="highlighter-rouge">usb_submit_urb</code>, at which point
you know you’re pretty close to the code doing the actual I/O.  At this point,
don’t get too caught up in completely understanding the source code. Simply take
a cursory look over the code, digging into some of the function definitions
along the way.  The next steps will help verify that how you believe the driver
behaves based on the source code is how the driver actually behaves in practice.</p>

<h3 id="packet-dumping-usb">Packet Dumping USB</h3>

<p>You’ll notice that at this point we haven’t talked much about the USB protocol.
The truth is, I’m not an expert on the protocol; in fact, I only have a
rudimentary working knowledge of the basic transfer types, which, it turns out,
is sometimes enough.  Rather than diving into the technical details of the USB
protocol here, I strongly suggest you instead consult a book on the protocol.
I’ve found the first few chapters of
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/USB-Complete-Fourth-Edition-Developers/dp/1931448086">USB Complete</a>
contain enough information to get up and running.  The most important thing is
understanding the different types of USB transfers and how they’re used.
Alternatively, you might refer to the free
<a href="http://www.beyondlogic.org/usbnutshell/usb1.shtml">USB in a NutShell</a> website.
Once you understand the basics, you’ll be able to read USB packet dumps.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever used Wireshark to capture network traffic, you’ll know how useful
a packet dump can be.  It’s essentially a debugger for the network.  Thankfully,
Linux comes equip with a command that will let you do the same sort of thing for
USB.  It’s called <code class="highlighter-rouge">usbmon</code>.  On some Linux distributions, to get access to the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">usbmon</code> command you’ll first need to load the module with <code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo modprobe
usbmon</code>.  To avoid dumping <em>all</em> USB traffic, you’ll want to target only the
specific bus your peripheral is running on.  The bus information was in fact
shown earlier in our call to <code class="highlighter-rouge">lsusb</code>.  For example, my device is operating on
bus 002:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Bus 002 Device 011: ID 0bda:8187 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL8187 Wireless
Adapter
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>At this point, unplug the USB peripheral.  Now, with the bus number in hand, you
can start capturing the USB packets, with a call like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/usb/usbmon/2u &gt; /tmp/my_peripheral.mon.out
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Note the <code class="highlighter-rouge">2</code> in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/sys/kernel/debug/usb/usbmon/2u</code> is indicating bus 2.  So to
monitor bus 1, you would instead use <code class="highlighter-rouge">/sys/kern...mon/1u</code>.</p>

<p>If I recall correctly, it’s important to ensure that the peripheral of interest
is the only peripheral operating on the given bus (which you can verify by
reading the output of <code class="highlighter-rouge">lsusb</code>).  For example, if a USB mouse is connected to the
same bus, the trace will be mixing packets from the two devices.  You may need
to experiment with plugging the peripheral into different USB ports to find an
empty bus.  More information about the <code class="highlighter-rouge">usbmon</code> command can be found
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/usb/usbmon.txt">here</a>.</p>

<p>What I ended up doing with the packet dump produced by my wireless USB
peripheral was to print the ~250 pages of hex and work through it in lockstep
with the Linux source code.  This turned out extremely useful in
cross-referencing the pattern of USB messages observed over the wire against the
Linux driver source code.  Every time I found a perceived discrepancy between
the two, I’d carefully work through the code until I could see how the two were
consistent.</p>

<h3 id="adding-logging-to-the-kernel-driver">Adding Logging to the Kernel Driver</h3>

<p>Another approach I found quite useful in analyzing the kernel driver was to
introduce logging statements into the driver source code.  This allowed me to
log variable values as the driver executed, which I would again try to match to
hex codes in the packet dump.</p>

<p>Under Linux, you can use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printk"><code class="highlighter-rouge">printk()</code></a>
function to print to the kernel log.  You may find that there are already calls
to <code class="highlighter-rouge">printk()</code> dispersed throughout the driver you’re analyzing.  Essentially I
downloaded the Linux source tree, made the relevant modifications to the code,
compiled the modified driver and inserted the new module into the running
operating system.  If your peripheral’s driver is a kernel module (as was the
case with mine), you can perform this operation without needing to reboot the
computer.  First however, you’ll need to establish the name of the kernel module
that corresponds to your driver.  The unsophisticated, though effective method I
used to achieve this was to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Restart Linux without the peripheral connected</li>
  <li>Run <code class="highlighter-rouge">lsmod</code> and keep note of the results</li>
  <li>Plug in the peripheral</li>
  <li>Run <code class="highlighter-rouge">lsmod</code> and compare the output to Step 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>If your driver is indeed a module which is dynamically loaded the first time the
peripheral is plugged in, you should see changes between the two runs of <code class="highlighter-rouge">lsmod</code>
which give away the name.  For example, the module name for my wireless USB
peripheral is <code class="highlighter-rouge">rtl8187</code> and appears in the output of Step 4 but not Step 2.  If
this doesn’t work for you, perhaps your driver isn’t implemented as a
dynamically loaded module.  Again, if anyone would like to contribute as to how
this scenario should be addressed, please contact me so that I can update the
article.</p>

<p>With the module name in hand, <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd</code> to the root of your modified Linux source
directory (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/linux-source</code>), then execute the following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>~/linux-source$ make
~/linux-source$ make ./drivers/path/to/your/driver.ko
~/linux-source$ rmmod &lt;your_module_name&gt;
~/linux-source$ insmod ./drivers/path/to/your/driver.ko
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The calls to <code class="highlighter-rouge">rmmod</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">insmod</code> should replace the old module in the running
kernel with your modified module.  The output of calls to <code class="highlighter-rouge">printk()</code> can be
found in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/var/log/kern.log</code>.</p>

<h3 id="porting-the-code-to-android">Porting the Code to Android</h3>

<p>What’s outlined above is a general guide to finding, exploring and analyzing the
behavior of an existing Linux USB peripheral driver.  With these tools in hand,
it’s time to finally begin porting the code over to Android.  Perhaps
surprisingly, this is actually now the easy part.  If you’ve followed faithfully
the steps above, you will have a reasonable idea about how your chosen
peripheral works, or at least some idea of the messages you need to emulate on
the wire.  From here, you can simply follow the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/usb/host.html">Android USB Host API Documentation</a>.
The documentation describes everything you need to know about registering your
Android application to be notified when your target peripheral is attached based
on the Vendor ID and Product ID.  All of the methods used to initiate I/O
between the Android device and the peripheral are also documented.  Again, it’s
important to understand the basics of the USB transfer types which are not
covered in this article.  Once you have this knowledge however, everything else
becomes easier.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Hopefully this article demystifies what’s involved in porting a USB driver from
Linux kernel space to Android user space.  Again, this article has been written
based on my own experience—if you have particular domain expertise in some
of the areas I’ve glossed over, please get in touch so that I can improve the
article.</p>
